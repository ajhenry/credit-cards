Let's say that a fraudster has skimmed your card at an ATM and watched you put in your PIN...

You'll have to call the bank, fill out an affidavit, get it notarized, mail it, and then _hope_ the bank sides in your favor

# How to use a credit card

### + build credit fast

--

## Step 1: Obtain a credit card

> Find a card that suites your spending

My general rule of thumb for if you should get a credit card

```python
if credit_card_count == 0:
    get_one()
else:
    get_one_anyway()
```

--

## Figure out your spending habits

<img src="content/images/categories.png" />

--

## Find cards for your categories

For me, ~70% of my spend falls into food, shopping, and rent

Use [credit card finders](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/credit-cards/restaurants) to help out with this

--

## Step 2: Don't carry a balance

> ⚠️ This is the most important step in using a credit card

Pay off your balance **in full** each month

--

## Step 3: Put at least 1 charge on it each month

> The biggest factor in determining credit score is <u>Payment History</u>

Setup auto pay and put a small charge of $1 on each of your cards each month

❗❗ 4 accounts with 12 payments over 2 years is 96 payments on your history ❗❗

# Churning 😮

--

Churning is where you open a credit card for the sign up bonus or other benefits (and then usually close the card shortly after)

--

This loses banks money, so let's look at an example of how

--

<div class="flex flex-row justify-center items-center">
    <div>
        <img src="content/images/plat.webp" class="w-64" />
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>The Amex Platinum Card</h3>
    </div>
</div>

<p>150,000 points after spending $6,000 in 6 months</p>

<p class="fragment fade-up">$6,000 x 0.075 + ($695 Annual Fee) = <span>$1,145</span></p>
<p class="fragment fade-up">156,000 x $0.01 = <span class="text-blue-500">$1,560</span></p>
<h3 class="fragment fade-up">Net loss for Amex<span class="text-red-500"> >$415</span></h3>

---

<h2>But wait, there's more</h2>

<p>Additional benefits of the platinum card</p>

<p class="fragment fade-up">Global Entry application fee covered <span class="text-red-500">-$100</span></p>
<p class="fragment fade-up">$240 in Uber credit <span class="text-red-500">-$240</span></p>

# How to Churn 101 🍎

--

##### Foreword

> Churning without a plan is pretty dumb so having a solid understanding of the process and how it affects your credit is **important**

Also having a good credit score will help you immensely i.e. >700

--

### 1. Monitoring your credit score

It's important to know how your credit score is doing and how it will be affected

New cards + hard inquiries = a drop of ~20 points max

> The more cards you have, the less your credit score will be impacted

--

### 2. Knowing The bank's rules

| Bank  | Rule | Max Cards/Bonuses       |
| ----- | ---- | ----------------------- |
| Chase | 5/24 | 5 cards every 24 months |
| Amex  | 2/90 | 2 cards every 90 days   |
| C1    | 1/6  | 1 card every 6 months   |
| Citi  | 1/24 | 1 bonus every 24 months |

--

### 3. Meet the sign up bonus requirements

Keep track of your sign up bonus goals via other apps or spreadsheets

> This is important if you have multiple cards churning at once

--

### A real example

<div class="flex flex-row space-x-12 justify-center">
    <div class="w-64">
        <img src="https://citicards.citi.com/content/dam/consumer-marketing/us-marketing-team/en/citi-cards-digital/aa-premier/ps/premier_card-ksqajx5x.jpg" />
        <p class="font-bold">Citi Premier</p>
        <p>80k for $4k in 4 months</p>
    </div>
    <div class="w-64">
        <img src="content/images/plat.webp" />
        <p class="font-bold">Amex Plat</p>
        <p>150k for $6k in 6 months</p>
    </div>
    <div class="w-64">
        <img src="https://cdn.prodstatic.com/shared/images/cards/278x175/ff304640-e963-11eb-a48f-65ac0bb53c5b.png" />
        <p class="font-bold">C1 Venture</p>
        <p>75k for $4k in 3 months</p>
    </div>
</div>

--

### The results

<h3 class="fragment fade-up">Total Time: ~6 months</h3>
<h3 class="fragment fade-up">Total Spend: $14,000</h3>
<h3 class="fragment fade-up">Total hit to credit: <span class="text-red-500"> 80-150 points</span></h3>
<h3 class="fragment fade-up">Rewards: 75k + 80k + 150k = 305k</h3>
<h3 class="fragment fade-up">Rewards Value: 305k * $0.01 =<span class="text-blue-500"> >$3000</span></h3>

### Professor's Notes

- Banks provide reconsideration lines if you are not approved for a card
- Churn with a friend to get referral bonuses 😄
- Business cards typically don't count towards the bank rules
