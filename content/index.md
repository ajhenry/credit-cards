Let's say that a fraudster has skimmed your card at an ATM and watched you put in your PIN...

## Uh oh 😭

You'll have to call the bank, fill out an affidavit, get it notarized, mail it, and then _hope_ the bank sides in your favor

# How to use a credit card

### + build credit fast

--

## Step 1: Obtain a credit card

My general rule of thumb for if you should get a credit card

```python
if credit_card_count == 0:
    get_one()
else:
    get_one_anyway()
```

--

## Bonus: Figure out your spending habits

--

## Find cards for your categories

For me, ~70% of my spend falls into food, shopping, and rent

Use [credit card finders](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/credit-cards/restaurants) to help out with this

--

## Step 2: Don't carry a balance

> This is the most important step in using a credit card

# Churning 😮

--

Churning is where you open a credit card for the sign up bonus or other benefits (and then usually close the card shortly after)

--

This loses banks money, so let's look at an example of how

--

<div class="flex flex-row justify-center items-center">
    <div>
        <img src="content/images/plat.webp" class="w-64"/>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>The Amex Platinum Card</h3>
    </div>
</div>

<p>150,000 points after spending $6,000 in 6 months</p>

<p class="fragment fade-up">$6,000 x 0.075 + ($695 Annual Fee) = <span>$1,145</span></p>
<p class="fragment fade-up">156,000 x $0.01 = <span class="text-blue-500">$1,560</span></p>
<h3 class="fragment fade-up">Net loss for Amex<span class="text-red-500"> >$415</span></h3>

--

<h2>But wait, there's more</h2>

<p>Additional benefits of the platinum card</p>
<p class="fragment fade-up">Global Entry application fee covered <span class="text-red-500">-$100</span></p>
<p class="fragment fade-up">$240 in Uber credit <span class="text-red-500">-$240</span></p>
<p class="fragment fade-up">TSA CLEAR fee covered <span class="text-red-500">-$189</span></p>
<h3 class="fragment fade-up">True Net loss for Amex<span class="text-red-500"> >$944</span></h3>

        Now you can see why banks don't like churning

# How to Churn 101 🍎

--

##### Foreword

> Churning without a plan is pretty dumb so having a solid understanding of the process and how it affects your credit is **important**

Also having a good credit score will help you immensely i.e. >700

--

### The Ground Rules

1. Monitor your credit score
2. Know the rules specific to each bank that backs the card
3. Make sure to meet the specific sign up bonus requirements
4. Take advantage of limited time bonuses and targeted offers

Use resources like [r/churning](https://m16p-churning.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Card+Recommendation+Flowchart+v18.html)

--

### 1. Monitoring your credit score

It's important to know how your credit score is doing and how it will be affected

New cards + hard inquiries = a drop of ~20 points max

--

### 2. Knowing The bank's rules

| Bank  | Rule | Max Cards/Bonuses       |
| ----- | ---- | ----------------------- |
| Chase | 5/24 | 5 cards every 24 months |
| Amex  | 2/90 | 2 cards every 90 days   |
| C1    | 1/6  | 1 card every 6 months   |
| Citi  | 1/24 | 1 bonus every 24 months |

---

If all done correctly, congrats, you beat the system!!!
